# Epileptic-Emergency-Support-App

The project aims to assist epileptic patients during emergencies. It involves an Android app with an emergency button that users can press to seek immediate help. When pressed, the button sends the user's name, phone number, and live location to the nearest hospital's web-based system.
<br>
The hospital's admin receives the information and, upon verification, tracks the patient's live location. They then dispatch an emergency response team to provide assistance.
<br>
The goal is to ensure that epileptic patients can quickly and easily access emergency medical help when needed.
